Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

*   Python 3.8 or newer
*   PyTorch 1.8 or newer
*   Ultralytics YOLOv5 (`pip install ultralytics`)
*   OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
*   PyYAML (`pip install pyyaml`)

### Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Folder Structure
----------------

Below is the folder structure for the project, including scripts, input-output files, and configuration:

├── readme_data.yaml            # Configuration file with data formats and types
├── train_predict.sh            # Script to initiate data downloading, preprocessing, training, and testing

```
Configuration File
------------------

The `readme_data.yaml` file contains all necessary data types and formats for model training and prediction. This YAML configuration is crucial for setting up the data correctly.

Training and Prediction
-----------------------

### Running the Training Script

To train and test the model, follow these steps:

1.  **Prepare the Data**: Run the `train_predict.sh` script to download and transform the data into the correct format. This prepares the data for training the YOLOv8n model using Ultralytics.
    
2.  **Check Compatibility**: The script then checks the compatibility of the model with the validation data to ensure that everything is set up correctly for training.
    
3.  **Train the Model**: The model is trained with the prepared data.
    
4.  **Test the Model**: After training, the model is tested on an image to evaluate its performance.
    

Run the script with the following command:

```bash
sh train_predict.sh
```

Dependencies
------------

This project relies on several key Python libraries and frameworks:

*   **PyTorch**: For model training and neural network capabilities.
*   **Ultralytics YOLOv5**: For accessing the YOLOv8n model and utilities.
*   **OpenCV**: For image processing and visualization.
*   **PyYAML**: For YAML file handling.

Ensure all dependencies are installed and up to date to avoid any issues during execution.
